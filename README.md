# Weather-Dashboard
A responsive and dynamic weather dashboard built with HTML, CSS, Javascript, Bootstrap, Moment.js, OpenWeather API and the browser's localStorage.


If the searched city is found on the OpenWeather current weather API endpoint, the 5 day forecast and UV index API endpoints are called, the city is saved to localStorage, and all the data is rendered to the page.
